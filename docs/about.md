# Stack Web API com Spring Boot

Develop and publish Web APIs based on **Stack Java** for **Cloud Native** environments, with **Spring Boot** and other Spring technologies.

This **Stack** makes available a set of solutions that facilitate the development, publish and connection with softwares and products of your company, helping to enable faster and more reliabe deliveries. The **Templates**, **Plugins** and **Stackfiles** were projected to offer a flexible start point, robust and secure to accelerate application-specific troubleshooting. 

So your development teams can focus on what really matters: **features and business rules**

### **Stack Structure**
A **Stack Web API with Spring Boot** was developed following the better practices of software design architecture: 
- Clean Architecture
- Continuous **Plugins** and **Templates** update to follow the technological modernization of the market, without neglecting the compatibility with previous versions;
- Easily testable code;
- Decoupled components;
- New features that can be quickly added by the dev team

The **Stack** presents a basic structure where the **Template** starts the entire development cycle, defining the language, the framework, and the base organization of the files. This makes sure your application can easily compile and run locally quickly.  

When using a **Stack** it's possible to add "superpowers" to your created project from a **Template**. To do it, you can apply **Plugins** of the **Stack**. For example, functionalities to provide information about availability, consumption, monitoring, metrics and tracing.

In practice, a **Plugin** can add dependencies to your project, create/change files and, if necessary, execute some terminal commands, among other possibilities. Furthermore, the **Stack** allows development teams to apply **Plugins** according to their own needs.
