## General Vision
### How the Tracing Plugin works

When applied, this plugin adds a class of configuration of _tracing_ making use of **`opentracing-spring-jaeger-web-starter`**.

When start the application, automatically, it connects and sends _tracing_ to an local endpoint.

For more information about **Jaeger** and how to deploy locally, see the [**jaegertracing**](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.37/deployment/) page.
