## **Use Case**
This use case is ideal to initialize Java projects with Spring Boot and logging support, being able to provide options to choose Gradle or Maven as a build tool.

It's possible to apply this plugin in the app-type application. Run the STK CLI command:
```bash
stk apply plugin graphene-java-api-stack/logging-plugin
```

With this the Java application with Spring Boot and gradle/maven will have support to _logging_
